# Customer-Segmentation-using-PCA

Problem Statement: Developed a customer segmentation model to identify distinct groups of customers based on purchasing behavior. The goal was to help businesses tailor their marketing strategies by understanding their customer base better.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset using Pandas and NumPy. Handled missing values, standardized the data using StandardScaler, and ensured proper encoding of categorical variables.

Dimensionality Reduction with PCA: Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dataset's dimensionality, ensuring efficient visualization and interpretation. Retained key components that explained 95% of the variance.

Clustering and Visualization: Implemented clustering algorithms like K-Means to segment the customers. Visualized the results using Matplotlib and Seaborn, providing clear insights into customer behavior.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated the segmentation quality using metrics like Silhouette Score and Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Business Impact: Delivered actionable insights to stakeholders, helping them personalize marketing campaigns, improve customer retention, and boost overall sales.
